# Welcome

**This is numerical analysis lecture note** for Mathematical Chemistry Class 2022-1. In this post, I am giving you the first homework to open and run the below python code: 

https://github.com/changwmyung/numerical_analysis_chem/blob/master/homework/hw00/Hello_World.ipynb

# print

For the first line, you will note that we are calling a function called print to print out a simple string "Hello World!"

```
print("Hello World!")
```

# Loading package

The second line is to load a package called numpy as np and to create a 1-D vector called a. We will later cover this in detail. This example is just to check if the package is installed correctly.

```
import numpy as np

a=np.array([0,1,2,3])
print(a)
```

Well done!
