# LU decomposition

The motivation for an LU decomposition is based on the observation that systems of equations involving triangular coefficient matrices are easier to deal with. Indeed, the whole point of Gaussian elimination is to replace the coefficient matrix with one that is triangular. The LU decomposition is another approach designed to exploit triangular systems.
