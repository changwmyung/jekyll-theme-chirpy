In this post, I am giving you the first homework to open and run the below python code:https://github.com/changwmyung/numerical_analysis_chem/blob/master/homework/hw00/Hello_World.ipynbprintFor the first line, you will note that we are calling a function called print to print out a simple string “Hello World!”print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)Loading packageThe second line is to load a package called numpy as np and to create a 1-D vector called a. We will later cover this in detail. This example is just to check if the package is installed correctly.import numpy as npa=np.array([0,1,2,3])print(a)Well done!" } ]
